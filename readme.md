# An Introduction to Hydra

## What is Hydra
Hydra is a live-coding library created by [Olivia Jack](https://github.com/ojack). While Hydra uses JavaScript, it is structured in a way that requires little intimate knowledge of JavaScript. If you are coming from another language, or are new to programming, you can build really interesting visuals in Hydra.

Essentially, Hydra takes an input → modifies it → and returns an output.
